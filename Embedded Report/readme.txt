This "readme.txt" file briefly tells how to start with this template.

The UET_EE_Latex_Template folder when unzipped, containts the following 
files and folders:

1) uet_thesis.tex -- This is the main file. It includes the information about the 
		     cover pages. It also includes the chapters and refrences


2) uet_thesis.cls -- This is the class file controlling the style of the thesis. 
		     It SHOULD NOT be edited/changed at all.


3) uet_thesis.bbl -- This is the bibliography file generated automatically. Do not 
		     edit this file.  
		     

4) refrences.bib -- All the refrences that you want to include will go  to this file.
		    To have the refrences in the right format to be copied into 
  		    this file use GoogleScholar. To do this open the Google Scholar 
		    webpage. Click the link 'Scholar Preferences'. Look for 
		    'Bibliography Manager' at the end of the page. There CHECK the 
		    option 'Show links to import citations into' and select 'BibTex'
		    from the drop down menu. Whenever you add a new reference you need 
		    update the bibliography file by executing 'BibTex' command.   



5) uet_thesis.pdf -- This is the final result when you compile the latex source 
		     code of 'uet_thesis.tex'. Make sure you always compile 
		     'uet_thesis.tex'.


6) Chapters -- 	This folder contains the different chapters you will write in the 
	       	thesis. Currently only two chapters are included. When you add a 
		new chapter, lets say chapter 3 then include it in the 'uet_thesis.tex'
		file as well.

7) Figures -- 	This folder will contain all the figures that you require in your 
		chapters. The figures can be of type '.pdf', '.jpg', '.tiff' and 
		some other types as well. Fo details see the appendix of the thesis 
		template.
